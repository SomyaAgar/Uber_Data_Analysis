# 🚗 **Uber Data Analysis (2016)**
## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of Uber rides in 2016. Using Python and key data science libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we extract actionable insights from a real-world dataset. The primary goal is to understand ride patterns, user behavior, and operational trends through exploratory data analysis and visualization.

## 🏢 **About Uber**

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Initial Exploration: Loaded and reviewed dataset structure.

### Data Cleaning:
- Removed irrelevant/missing rows.
- Standardized date-time formats.
- Handled missing categorical values via imputation or separate category tagging.

### Feature Extraction:
- Derived new time-based features (hour, part of day).
- Categorized trips based on time slots: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night.

### Visualization Prep:
- Grouped and aggregated data for meaningful insights.

## 📈 Data Visualization Techniques
Utilized a range of Python visualization libraries to reveal hidden patterns:
- Bar Charts
- Count Plots
- Displots
- Line Charts

## 🔍 Key Insights
- 🚘 Business rides far outnumber personal rides.
- 📅 Fridays see the highest volume of rides in a week.
- ⏰ Peak ride bookings occur in the afternoon (10 AM – 3 PM).
- ❄️ Ride bookings drop significantly in winter months (Nov, Dec, Jan).
- 📍 Meetings are the most frequently stated purpose for business travel.
- 📏 Most rides are under 25 miles, with usage dropping as distance increases.
- ❓ A large number of rides have missing purpose labels, highlighting a data quality challenge often seen in real-world datasets.
