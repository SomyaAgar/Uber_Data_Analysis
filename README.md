#  **Uber Data Analysis**
## **Project Overview**
The project involves an end-to-end data analysis of Uber rides in 2016. With Python and major data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we derive meaningful insights from an authentic dataset. The main objective is exploratory data analysis and visualization to learn ride patterns, user behavior, and operational trends.

## **About Uber**
Uber Technologies, Inc. is an international transportation and mobility corporation based in San Francisco. It operates in more than 70 countries and 15,000 cities, and it is the world's largest ride-sharing platform, connecting an average of 28 million trips every day. Uber offers services in mobility, delivery, freight, and autonomous transport.

## **Dataset Summary**
Total Records: 1,157
Source: Uber rides (USA) – Year: 2016

### Features:
#### Column	Description
                                   
START_DATE : Date and time when the ride started               
END_DATE   : Date and time when the ride ended                 
CATEGORY   : Type of ride (e.g., Business, Personal)           
START      : Ride pickup location                              
STOP       : Ride drop-off location                            
MILES      : Total miles traveled                              
PURPOSE    : Purpose of the ride (Entertainment, Meal, etc.)   

## Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Initial Exploration: Loaded and explored dataset structure.

### Data Cleaning:
- Removed irrelevant/missing rows.
- Standardized date-time formats.
- Handled missing categorical values via imputation or separate category tagging.
### Feature Extraction:
- Derived new time-based features (hour, part of day).
- Categorized trips based on time slots: Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night.

## Data Visualization Techniques
Utilized a range of Python visualization libraries to reveal patterns:
- Bar Charts
- Count Plots
- Displots
- Line Charts

## Key Insights
- Business rides exceeds the number of personal rides.
- Most of the rides in one week are on Fridays.
- Afternoon (10 AM – 3 PM) is the peak time of booking rides.
- Ride bookings drop significantly in winter months (Nov, Dec, Jan).
- Meetings are the most frequently stated purpose for business travel.
- The majority of rides are less than 25 miles, with use declining with increasing distance.
- The majority of rides lack purpose labels, underscoring a data quality issue common in real-world datasets.

## Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

## Project Outcomes:
- Real-world data wrangling
- Time-based feature engineering
- Handling missing data
- Data-driven storytelling
- Business insight visualization
